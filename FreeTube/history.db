{"videoId":"wPnTpokDZYk","title":"Avi Loeb Strikes Back: Answering the Critics!","author":"Dr Brian Keating","authorId":"UCmXH_moPhfkqCk6S3b9RWuw","published":1701812818000,"description":"Avi Loeb was recently critiqued by Professor Desch (ASU) with Alan Jackson (Towson) have written a detailed critique of the &quot;interstellar spherules&quot; preprint by Loeb et al. https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.07699.pdf\n\nIn their critique, Desch and Jackson claim that assertions by Loeb et al that that the CNEOS bolide 2014-01-08 was interstellar; that spherules recovered from the seafloor near the airburst were associated with this bolide; that they had Fe isotopic ratios indicating origin as micrometeorites; that they had unusual chemical compositions enriched in Be, La and U, never seen before in micrometeorite spherules; that these compositions were formed in the magma ocean stage of a differentiated extrasolar planet; and that the Be abundance reflected passage through the interstellar medium are not substantiated. \n\n\nThey explain ‚ÄúDespite not being peer-reviewed, the (Loeb et al.) manuscript has been reported by media outlets as &quot;published&quot;, and its conclusions have been widely distributed as fact. The purpose of this manuscript is to provide potential peer reviewers and the general public with an appreciation of the multiple fatal flaws with the manuscript&apos;s arguments. \n\nWe discuss the published evidence that the 2014-01-08 bolide is not interstellar. We show that there is no statistical spatial correlation of a chemical signature or even number of recovered spherules with the 2014-01-08 bolide. We demonstrate that the Fe isotopic ratios decisively indicate an origin in our Solar System, with greater than 99.995% probability. We demonstrate that the unusual enrichments in La, U, etc., have in fact been observed in micrometeorites before and attributed to terrestrial contamination; and that the Be abundances are similarly consistent with those of ferromanganese nodules, after reacting with sea water. Far from being exotic particles from an extrasolar planet, the spherules collected and analyzed by Loeb et al. appear to be just like those found around the world, with a Solar System origin and compositions modified by tens of thousands of years residence at the ocean bottom.\n\nCheck out my discussion about Avi Loeb on the Joe Rogan Experience on YouTube  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPmxrKKu67k&t=0s and on Spotify https://sptfy.com/OL2e  and here: Why Isn&apos;t Avi Loeb Going After Oumuamua? | Brian Keating on Joe Rogan https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDJL3TGTMr0&t=0s\n\nFollow Avi‚Äôs Galileo Project (@thegalileoproject6679)\n\nAdditional resources: \n\nüì∫ Watch my most popular videos: \nNeil Turok https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt5cFLN65fI&t=0s\nFrank Wilczek https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z8RqKMQHe0&t=0s\n\n‚û°Ô∏è Follow me on your fav platforms:\n‚úñÔ∏è Twitter: https://twitter.com/DrBrianKeating \nüîî YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/DrBrianKeating?sub_confirmation=1 \nüìù Join my mailing list: https://briankeating.com/mailing_list \n‚úçÔ∏è Check out my blog: https://briankeating.com/blog.php \nüéôÔ∏è Follow my podcast: https://briankeating.com/podcast \n\nInto the Impossible with Brian Keating is a podcast dedicated to all those who want to explore the universe within and beyond the known.\n\nMake sure to subscribe so you never miss an episode!\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/intotheimpossible\">#intotheimpossible</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/briankeating\">#briankeating</a> üì¢ Ownership of your health starts with AG1.
